She had her chicken panini, chips, and mango ice tea, and I had my beef steak and mochaccino. The meal was simple, yet with her across the table, it felt perfect.</p><p>Afterward, we went to watch Saiyaara in the premium theatre. The movie was beautiful, but the moment that stole my soul was when I reached for her hand. She gave me hers willingly, and in that touch, I felt warmth, comfort, and magic.</p><p>Later, I gave her small gifts, chocolate, perfume, and a bracelet. I even handed her a $5 note, asking her to keep it as a souvenir, a little piece of me she could carry with her. We spoke, and I confessed to her the pull I felt towards her since the beginning.</p><p>I dropped her home at 21:30, but my heart refused to leave her.

At the top, the title read, “For Aliah, My Confessions & Promises 💌”. The whole page was glowing in a dark starry theme with soft colors of pink, blue, and gold. Cards filled the screen, each one hiding a confession or a promise. When tapped, they would flip, reveal words from my heart, and sprinkle confetti, like little celebrations of love.</p><p>In the sidebar, I left her a message, “Aliah, I fell for your voice, your smile, your sweetness, your cute clumsy magic, and I want to cherish you with love, care and a lifetime of little adventures. No pressure, no rushing, just us, going with the flow, and when you’re ready, we dream and plan together in shaa Allah. 🌸”</p><p>There was also a modal called Our Pace with a reminder, “No pressure, no forcing, let’s go with the flow.

So after work I drove from Ebene to Port Louis to pick her up myself, and together we returned to Blacksheeep in Ebene.</p><p>We shared a plate of creamy chicken mushroom tagliatelle, one meal between us, forkful after forkful like a dance of love. She drank water, and I had a strawberry daiquiri, yet the real sweetness was in sharing.</p><p>After dinner we went to the theater to watch <em>Conjuring, The Last Rites</em>. The movie itself was nothing frightening, but she barely watched it. Her eyes kept searching for me, admiring me, her fingers finding mine, holding firmly. She leaned her head against my shoulder, and I felt her warmth flow into me. We even played our little game of thumb war, laughing together whenever the so called scary character appeared on the screen. It was not the film that captured me, but her presence, her touch, her laughter.</p><p>In the theater I kissed her hands and even breathed in their scent, a gesture that felt sacred. When the night ended, before dropping her home, I placed a gentle kiss on her cheek, our very first. That soft kiss, simple and pure, carried the weight of my affection, my joy, my love.</p>"

There we had Alouda, hers was a small kulfi one, mine was a large pistachio, and we shared sips of each, tasting each other’s choices.</p><p>Back in the car, laughter and play filled the space. I teased her with a fake cockroach, and though it scared her at first, she kept it simply because it came from me. I gave her five tiny keychains with a little note, calling them a pocket hug, so she could hold them and think of me whenever she wished.</p><p>We hugged, and in that embrace I felt comfort, safety, peace, and home all at once. I realized how truly lucky I am, Alhamdulillah, to have her in my life. Every moment beside her is a blessing. Before her father came to fetch her, I dropped her back home, my heart still wrapped in her presence.</p>"

She was shy, so shy that she did not speak a word for almost half an hour.</p><p>We went to Panarottis on Edith Cavell Street and had dinner, the three of us. When I gave Aliah a sip of my drink, her fingers brushed against mine while holding the glass, and it felt like electricity flowing through me. She did not want her sister to notice the way we hold hands, hug, and stay close, so I teased her with my feet under the table instead.</p><p>After dinner we took some selfies, and among them was our very first cheeks kiss selfie, one that I absolutely adore. When we leaned close, I looked into her eyes and saw her biting her glossy lips, so tempting, and I wanted to kiss her, but I resisted.</p><p>Afterward I dropped them home. Alisha is adorable, even in her silence, and though she barely spoke, I know that with time she will open up and feel at ease with me.

I even fed her some chips, and it was so cute, like a little piece of love wrapped in laughter.</p><p>Before dinner, while waiting for the food, we sat near the sea on a bench. I held her close as the breeze wrapped around us, and in that moment it felt just like home. With her, I feel peace, comfort, and everything I have ever longed for.</p><p>Later, in the car, I gave her a small gift, an earphone so she could use it to talk to me at night, whispering softly into the mic as though she were right beside me. We talked, laughed, hugged, held hands, and filled the air with our crazy and cute selfies.</p><p>And then came the moment that changed everything. She was blabbering sweetly, her eyes restless, her feet shifting, her gaze dropping to my lips again and again. I held her face gently, pulled her close, and kissed her on the lips. For a second she was shocked, her eyes wide with astonishment, but then she melted into it. She told me it was her dream, her first kiss, and it was everything she had imagined.</p><p>We kissed again, and this time our lips lingered, soft yet intense, melting into a French kiss. It was a kiss full of emotions, full of feelings, a kiss that spoke more than words could ever carry. Her lips tasted sweet, intoxicating, addictive, leaving me yearning for more even as they parted. Her scent wrapped around me, her closeness overwhelmed me, and it felt like peace, like comfort, like home itself.</p><p>Even now, I am already missing the taste of her lips, the way her breath mingled with mine, the way her body leaned into me as if we belonged to each other. Tonight was more than a kiss, it was a promise, a memory etched forever in my soul.</p>"
