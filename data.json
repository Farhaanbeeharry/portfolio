I opened the door for her, wanting to make her feel as special as she is.</p><p>We went for a late lunch at Maison de thé, Telfair. She had her chicken panini, chips, and mango ice tea, and I had my beef steak and mochaccino. The meal was simple, yet with her across the table, it felt perfect.</p><p>Afterward, we went to watch Saiyaara in the premium theatre. The movie was beautiful, but the moment that stole my soul was when I reached for her hand. She gave me hers willingly, and in that touch, I felt warmth, comfort, and magic.</p><p>Later, I gave her small gifts, chocolate, perfume, and a bracelet. I even handed her a $5 note, asking her to keep it as a souvenir, a little piece of me she could carry with her. We spoke, and I confessed to her the pull I felt towards her since the beginning.</p><p>I dropped her home at 21:30, but my heart refused to leave her. That night, I knew I had fallen in love with Aliah. We captured the day in selfies, but the real treasure is the memory engraved in my heart forever.</p>"

I created a whole website just for Aliah, to confess my feelings and to make promises to her.</p><p>The site opened with our selfie together, framed like a treasure. At the top, the title read, “For Aliah, My Confessions & Promises 💌”. The whole page was glowing in a dark starry theme with soft colors of pink, blue, and gold. Cards filled the screen, each one hiding a confession or a promise. When tapped, they would flip, reveal words from my heart, and sprinkle confetti, like little celebrations of love.</p><p>In the sidebar, I left her a message, “Aliah, I fell for your voice, your smile, your sweetness, your cute clumsy magic, and I want to cherish you with love, care and a lifetime of little adventures. No pressure, no rushing, just us, going with the flow, and when you’re ready, we dream and plan together in shaa Allah. 🌸”</p><p>There was also a modal called Our Pace with a reminder, “No pressure, no forcing, let’s go with the flow. When you feel ready to commit, tell me and we’ll plan our future together, in shaa Allah. 💍”</p><p>And then came the heart of it, my confessions and promises for her, one by one, decorated with emojis, they are all in this website, below !</p><p>That night, I felt like I had given her not just a website, but a piece of my soul, wrapped in words, colors, confetti, and love.</p>"
